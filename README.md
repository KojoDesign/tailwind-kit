> TailwindKit is under active development. Expect changes.

TailwindKit (or TWKit for short) isn't another [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) component library. In fact, it's the opposite.

TailwindKit is a swiss-army plugin for TailwindCSS that provides several useful utility classes for building high-quality websites – all wrapped up in a single package. 

## Installing

The repo is currently under active development, so right now there is only a prerelease out.

Install it from NPM:

```bash
$ npm install @kojodesign/tailwindkit@next
```

Then add it to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
import kit from '@kojodesign/tailwindkit';

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [kit]
};
```
