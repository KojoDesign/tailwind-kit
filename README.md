> TailwindKit is under active development. Expect changes.

TailwindKit (or TWKit for short) isn't another [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) component library. In fact, it's the opposite.

TailwindKit is a swiss-army plugin for TailwindCSS that provides several useful utility classes for building high-quality websites. 

Some utilities that are added by TailwindKit include:

- 🔤 A custom typography plugin for creating styled typographic systems like the one found in [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/type-scale-tokens)
- 🏃 Utility classes for creating composable animations (based on [tailwindcss-animate](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/tailwindcss-animate))
- ⌛ Easing classes for animation and transition timing functions (based on [tailwindcss-easing](https://github.com/ixkaito/tailwindcss-easing))
- 👥 Animation groups for easily creating staggered entrance and exit animations
- ⚖️ Generated text sizes given a type [scale or ratio](https://typescale.com/).

The repo is currently under active development and hasn't yet been published to NPM, so be sure to ⭐ and keep an eye open for its first release!
